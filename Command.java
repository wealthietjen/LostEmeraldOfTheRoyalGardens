/**
 * This class is part of the "Lost Emerald of the Royal Gardens" application. 
 * "Lost Emerald of the Royal Gardens" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command consists of a maximum of three strings.
 * 
 * A command can consist of two strings, a command word and a second
 * word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
 * obviously are "take" and "map").
 * 
 * A command can consist of three strings, a command word and the following two
 * words that will be processed as a singular entity instead of two separate ones. 
 * (for example, if the command was "read fallen note", then the command word will be
 * "read", and "fallen note" will be considered as one entity)
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
